<u>Deep copy:</u>

In Ruby, there's no built-in or easy way to create a deep copy or deep freeze objects within objects. There are various ways of implementing such functionality but that's beyond the scope of this lesson. It is important therefore to really be aware of how exactly `freeze`, `dup` and `clone` work and the side effects they have. When working with collections, especially nested collections, one of the key things to be aware of is the level within the collection at which you are working.
